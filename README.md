# 🚗 Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning

Car Price Prediction is a regression-based machine learning project that aims to predict the selling price of a car based on various features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Car prices depend on several features like brand, year, mileage, fuel type, and transmission. Predicting car prices accurately helps buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains details like:
- Car Name
- Year
- Present Price
- Kms Driven
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission
- Owner
- Selling Price (Target Variable)

Dataset Source: [Available on Kaggle or UCI Repository]

## 🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Selection and Encoding
4. Model Training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)
5. Model Evaluation
6. Final Prediction

## 📈 Model Performance
Achieved good accuracy using Random Forest Regressor with R² Score and Mean Absolute Error as evaluation metrics.
